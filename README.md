django-faceted-search
=====================

This django application provides helper utilities for use with 
[django-haystack](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack). Parts of the
code were presented at a [Toronto Django Meetup](http://www.djangotoronto.com/),
in the [Faceted Navigation with django-haystack and solr](http://www.slideshare.net/Nagyman/faceted-navigation-using-django-haystack-and-solr)
presentation, by @Nagyman, hosted by [G Adventures](https://www.gadventures.com).

This code was extracted from a larger (private) code base, but was
independently developed by Craig Nagy and subsequently maintained at G Adventures.

#### TODO:
